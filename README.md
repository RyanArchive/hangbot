# hangbot

A word game (a little similar to Hangaroo) using Java and JFrame.

<br>

## Additional Context

Just like in Hangaroo, the user needs to guess the word/s through selecting the missing letters. However, some mechanics are different.

### Instruction

- There are five levels, one word each
- Hint letters are randomly selected for a word
- Only two wrong guess of letters are allowed per level
- Game over for third wrong guess, but is allowed to play again for same level
- A wrong guess of letter will remove a part of the robot (right and left arm)

### Note

- All words are static or pre-defined
- The background, robot, buttons and texts are all images
- When reached the end, it will not go back to the start
- Needs to be re-executed the program in order to be played again
